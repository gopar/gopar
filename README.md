I help teams **make Django + Postgres fast** — fixing slow queries, eliminating N+1s, and improving p50–p99 latency through ORM tuning, indexing, and config optimization.

- 🐘 Postgres query tuning (EXPLAIN/ANALYZE, indexing, vacuum/config tuning)
- 🧪 Building tools + content around Python performance & database internals
- 📝 Writing technical deep-dives on my blog: https://www.pygopar.com

### 🌱 Currently
